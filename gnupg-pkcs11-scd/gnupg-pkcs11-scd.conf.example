# The following attributes can be set for each provider:
#
# library
#	Full path to the PKCS#11 shared library (= provider).
# allow-protected-auth
#	Allow protected authentication for provider. This needs to be supported by
#	the provider and you should have appropriate reader hardware.
# cert-private
#	Authentication is required before certificates can be accessed. Most
#	configurations store certificates as public, so there is no need to use this
#	option.
# private-mask
#	Private key mask mode. Use this only when you have problem using
#	private key operations. The value is hex encoded mask number.
#	0	Determine automatically.
#	1	Force sign.
#	2	Force sign with recovery.
#	4	Force decrypt.
#	8	Force decrypt with unwrap.
