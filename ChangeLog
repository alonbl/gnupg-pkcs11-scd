2006-10-20 -- Version 0.02

 * Added more characters to serialization exclude chars.
   People may need to re-learn cards.

 * Fixed configure GPG_HOME typeo, thanks to Bob Dunlop.

 * Unlike gpg-agent, gnupg-pkcs11-scd supports more than
   one token available at the same time. In order to make
   gpg-agent happy, gnupg-pkcs11-scd always returns the
   same card serial number to gpg-agent.
   When unavailable token is requested, gnupg-pkcs11-scd
   will use NEEDPIN callback in order to ask for the
   requested token.
   When and if gpg-agent will support more than one serial
   number or NEEDTOKEN callback, this behavior will be
   modified.

 * Works as single threaded win32 server. Implementing
   multi-threaded server forces copy of win32 socket handling
   from gnupg, and it is GPLed.
   When libassuan will handle sockets we will be able to
   implement it.

 * Added system wide configuration file, thanks to Bub Dunlop.

 * Some more minor fixes.

2006-10-11 -- Version 0.01

 * Initial release.
