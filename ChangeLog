????-??-?? - Version 0.7.5

 * Fix issue with decrypting padded data, thanks to smunaut.
 * Catchup with gnupg-2.1 changes which caused inability to support
   both gpg and gpgsm. Implementation had to change card serial
   number, as a result current keys of gpg will look for the
   previous serial card.
   emulate-openpgpg option is obsoleted and removed.

   ACTION REQUIRED
   in order to assign new card serial number to existing keys,
   delete all PKCS#11 secret keys using:
       gpg --delete-secret-keys $KEY then
   Then regenerate keys using:
       gpg --card-edit
       admin
       generate
   Do not replace keys!
   gpg will learn the private keys of the new card and attach to
   the existing public keys.
 * Support gnupg-2.1 add existing key to master key.
   This feature makes the explicit settings in configuration obsolete.

2017-01-18 - Version 0.7.4

2011-04-09 -- Version 0.7.2

 * Some cleanups, thanks to Timo Schulz.
 * Sync hashing algorithms for OpenPGP.

2011-03-16 -- Version 0.7.1

 * Sync with gnupg-2.0.17.

2010-05-28 -- Version 0.7.0

 * Add timegm() replacement, thanks to Lars Silvén.
 * Sync with gnupg-2.0.14 commands.
 * Need assuan-2.

2008-01-19 -- Version 0.06

 * Fixed uninitializied gnutls datum, thank to Volodya
   Vaynshteyn for his help.

 * Sync with gnupg-2.0.8 assuan usage.

 * Some minor fixups.

2007-10-05 -- Version 0.05

 * Fixed a change in gnupg protocol for openpgp
   emulation, thanks to Nick Kossifidis for testing.

 * Added key timestamp on OpenPGP key generation,
   thanks to Daniel Benoy for reporting and testing.

2007-06-13 -- Version 0.04

 * Build system fixups.

 * RPM packaging is available, thank to Eddy Nigg.

 * Debian packaging is available, thank to Sandro Wefel.

 * Hacks to support for OpenPGP smartcard emulation,
   please refer the man page.

2007-01-05 -- Version 0.03

 * Fixed some Intel C compiler warnings.

 * pkcs11-helper is now external dependency.

 * Decrypt support unwrap now, thanks for
   Christoph Neerfeld help.

 * Configuration file sign-mode was renamed to
   private-mask.

2006-10-20 -- Version 0.02

 * Added more characters to serialization exclude chars.
   People may need to re-learn cards.

 * Fixed configure GPG_HOME typeo, thanks to Bob Dunlop.

 * Unlike gpg-agent, gnupg-pkcs11-scd supports more than
   one token available at the same time. In order to make
   gpg-agent happy, gnupg-pkcs11-scd always returns the
   same card serial number to gpg-agent.
   When unavailable token is requested, gnupg-pkcs11-scd
   will use NEEDPIN callback in order to ask for the
   requested token.
   When and if gpg-agent will support more than one serial
   number or NEEDTOKEN callback, this behavior will be
   modified.

 * Works as single threaded win32 server. Implementing
   multi-threaded server forces copy of win32 socket handling
   from gnupg, and it is GPLed.
   When libassuan will handle sockets we will be able to
   implement it.

 * Added system wide configuration file, thanks to Bub Dunlop.

 * Some more minor fixes.

2006-10-11 -- Version 0.01

 * Initial release.
